                <h1>About this project</h1>
                <p>Prior to learning to program, I spent over 20 years in the retail management field.  The majority of that time was spent within the Assets Protection part of retail as well as Assistand Store Manager of a high volume big box home improvement center.  During this time in retail, I witnessed companies slow creep forward in their attempts to keep thier companies up to date with the latest technology for thier employees.  I often wondered what kinds of technology could the companies provide to thier employees to make their jobs easier as well as make the flow of information more efficient company wide.  And so with this project, I decided to try to imulate some of the features seen in apps that fortune 50 companies provide to their employees.  While There is still plenty that can be done with an applications like this, I only have had 3 weeks of React progamming prior to this and only a week's time to complete my first React project.

                The application is similar to the ones that thousands of employees in various companies carry around on hand held devices.  Working in an environment where there are 40,000 plus individual SKU's, each with thier own set of information, can be challenging without the help of computers and applications to keep track of it all.  My application is designed from the perspective of an employee of a company who must interact with hundreds of SKU's a day.  They rely on applications to give them information on the SKU such as price, qty onhand, order information, etc.</p>

                <p>And while this project is nowhere near what I envision the final project to be, I believe it is a great starting point for someone who has only been developing with react for 3 weeks, and only 4 weeks prior just introduced to JavaScript.</p>
