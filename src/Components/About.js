                <h1>About this project</h1>
                <p>Prior to attending Flatiron School, I worked in the retail industry for over 20 years.  Most of that time was spent working in the loss prevention side of retail where keeping track of inventory was paramont.  I eventually moved to worked as an Assistant Store Manager of a high volule big box home improvement center for a forturen 40 company.  During my tenure, I witnessed the transformations companies underwent while trying to stay relevant in the world of technology.  I can remember using pencil and paper to keep track of things like inventory, budgets etc.  During that time, I saw the technology solutions that companies rolled out to their employees to make keeping track of inventory and sales. Sometimes it was disaster.  Other times the solutions companies rolled out was exaxtly what the employees needed.  Throughout the years I would often wish I could develope the solution.  After all, I was in the trenches day in and day out.  I new what the employees needed.  </p>

                <p>And while this project is nowhere near what I envision the final project to be, I believe it is a great starting point for someone who has only been developing with react for 3 weeks, and only 4 weeks prior just introduced to JavaScript.</p>
