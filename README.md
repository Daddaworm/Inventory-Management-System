## PROJECT NAME
    Inventory Management System

## DESCRIPTION
    Prior to learning to program, I spent over 20 years in the retail management field.  The majority of that time was spent within the Assets Protection part of retail as well as Assistand Store Manager of a high volume big box home improvement center.  During this time in retail, I witnessed companies slow creep forward in their attempts to keep thier companies up to date with the latest technology for thier employees.  I often wondered what kinds of technology could the companies provide to thier employees to make their jobs easier as well as make the flow of information more efficient company wide.  And so with this project, I decided to try to imulate some of the features seen in apps that fortune 50 companies provide to their employees.  While There is still plenty that can be done with an applications like this, I only have had 3 weeks of React progamming prior to this and only a week's time to complete my first React project.

    The application is similar to the ones that thousands of employees in various companies carry around on hand held devices.  Working in an environment where there are 40,000 plus individual SKU's, each with thier own set of information, can be challenging without the help of computers and applications to keep track of it all.  My application is designed from the perspective of an employee of a company who must interact with hundreds of SKU's a day.  They rely on applications to give them information on the SKU such as price, qty onhand, order information, etc.  

## Blog
    As part of the development process, certain concepts were harder to grasp than others.  Passing of props and component structure was one of the concepts.  To ensure that I understood the passing of props from one componenet to another, I took the liberty to write a blog post about the subject which can be read here :  https://ethan-rodriguez.medium.com/passing-props-into-functional-components-react-javascript-c5fafaeccb4a

## Running this application
    SERVER:
    This applications runs off of a mock back-end server that I created using a db.json file.  to initiate the server, open terminal and run the command: json-server --watch db.json

    NPM
    To run the applications, start the json server first (see above)....Then open another terminal and run the following commands.  
    In the terminal run the command: npm install
    After npm install runs, In the same terminal, run the command: npm start

## Where to go for support
    If there are any issues with the application or want to contact me for any reason, please contact me at ethan.r.rodriguez@gmail.com

## Changelog
    All notable changes to this project will be documented on this file
    [Unreleased]
    [Version 1.0.0]

## Roadmap
    While this applications is nowhere near complete.  There is much more functionality that can be implimented in the future.  As my knowledge of JavaScript and React grow.  I will continue to add additional functionality to the app.  A few ideas are...
        1) Ability to adjust inventory onhands
        2) Connect app to a real backend once I learn Ruby
        3) Ability to make POST request directly from the app
        4) Ability to add a secondary text area allowing user to search by name as well as the already included SKU search.
